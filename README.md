# yolov4_reolink

TODO: proper readme file for usage
 
Issues I encountered so far:

you need to compile darknet yolov4 with CUDA enabled. Go through https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/ and test to make sure that the darknet executable is working. This can be a very long process.

CUDA_PATH environment variable needs to be set.
